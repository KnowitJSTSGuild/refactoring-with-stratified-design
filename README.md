# Workshop

Choose between (or do both):

> Note: a) probably works better in a pair setting, b) might also work but
> you'd probably have to pair up with a person on the same team

a. Take a look at files at `./examples/`

- Before starting, launch the test suite by running `npm test`
- look at the code and try to figure out a logical structure
- stratify the code to logical layers better corresponding to the level of
  detail of the function at hand
- refactor and see if the tests still pass
- If time allows:
  - sketch call graphs of the original code and the refactored code
  - compare

b. Think about a piece of code you wrote today / this week

- Think about the strata in that code
- sketch out a call graph with arrows of different length
- Think about possible refactorings:
  - would it make sense to move something around
  - would that bring any benefits in terms of maintainability / readability / testability?
